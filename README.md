This project aimed to develop effective classification models to identify potential loan defaulters and assist financial institutions in mitigating credit risk. We utilized logistic regression and random forest models, iteratively refining our predictor set from 45 to 15 variables to align with the principle of parsimony. The final logistic model emphasized interpretability, while the optimized random forest model with 8 predictors achieved the best performance with an AUC of 79.19%. Our recommendation is to adopt the 15-predictor logistic model for transparent risk assessment and the 8-variable random forest model for operational deployment. We recommend that banks implement the 15-variable logistic model for clear risk profiling and the 8-variable random forest model for operational deployment in real-time systems. In particular, we identified three key predictors which are loan-to-goods ratio, days employed, and age, as critical indicators of default risk. All model code, exploratory data analysis, and supporting scripts are included in the Code and Dataset folder, and the final report and presentation are also provided in the repository.
