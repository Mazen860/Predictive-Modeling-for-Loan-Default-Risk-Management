Our project, "Predictive Modeling for Loan Default Risk Management," aimed to develop effective classification models to identify potential loan defaulters and assist financial institutions in mitigating credit risk. We utilized logistic regression and random forest models, iteratively refining our predictor set from 45 to 15 variables to align with the principle of parsimony. The final logistic model emphasized interpretability, while the optimized random forest model with 8 predictors achieved the best performance with an AUC of 79.19%. Our recommendation is to adopt the 15-predictor logistic model for transparent risk assessment and the 8-variable random forest model for operational deployment. All model code, exploratory data analysis, and supporting scripts are included in the Code and Dataset folder, and the final report and presentation are also provided in the repository.
